  summary: Provide beacon node with proposals for the given validators.
  description: |
    Prepares the beacon node for potential proposers by supplying information
    required when proposing blocks for the given validators.  The information
    supplied for each validator index is considered persistent until overwritten
    by new information for the given validator index, or until the beacon node
    restarts.

    Note that because the information is not persistent across beacon node restarts
    it is recommended that either the beacon node is monitored for restarts or this
    information is refreshed by resending this request periodically (for example,
    each epoch).

    Also note that requests containing currently inactive or unknown validator
    indices will be accepted, as they may become active at a later epoch.
