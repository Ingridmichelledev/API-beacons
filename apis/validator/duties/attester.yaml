  summary: "Get attester duties"
  operationId: "getAttesterDuties"
  description: "Requests the beacon node to provide a set of attestation duties,
    which should be performed by validators, for a particular epoch.

    Duties should only need to be checked once per epoch,
    however a chain reorganization (of > MIN_SEED_LOOKAHEAD epochs) could occur,
    resulting in a change of duties. For full safety, you should subscribe to chain reorganizations events."
