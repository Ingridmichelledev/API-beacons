  summary: "Get block proposers duties"
  operationId: "getProposerDuties"
  description: "Request beacon node to provide all validators that are scheduled to propose a block in the given epoch.

    Duties should only need to be checked once per epoch,
    however a chain reorganization (of > MIN_SEED_LOOKAHEAD epochs) could occur,
    resulting in a change of duties. For full safety, you should monitor head events and confirm the
    previous_duty_dependent_root or current_duty_dependent_root in the head event matches the
    dependent_root in this response.

    The dependent_root value is `get_block_root_at_slot(state, compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch) - 1)`
    or the genesis block root in the case of underflow."
